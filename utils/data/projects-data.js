        description: ' I worked on backend systems for building a Patient Care Dashboard designed to streamline healthcare workflows. We integrated FHIR standards to ensure interoperability and structured data exchange. A key feature was NLP-based tokenization of patient notes — automatically extracting critical information and displaying it as structured tokens on the dashboard for quick insights and analysis. These tokens also powered visualizations like interactive graphs and trends, helping care teams make faster, data-driven decisions. The system was built for efficiency, scalability, and real-world clinical use.',
